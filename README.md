# Personal Page — Edwin Olivera

Welcome — this repository contains the source files for my personal website published with GitHub Pages.

## Description

This repo serves as the foundation for my personal website (GitHub Pages). It is organized so you can view the source code (HTML/CSS/JS) and easily deploy changes directly from the main branch.

> Note: I assume your site's URL is: https://edwinolivera.github.io  
If the URL is different, please update it below in the "Demo" section.

## Demo

Published site: https://edwinolivera.github.io

## Repository structure

- `index.html` — Main page (site entry).
- `assets/` — Images, fonts, and other static assets.
- `css/` — Stylesheets.
- `js/` — JavaScript scripts (if any).
- `README_NEW.md` — This file (improved README version).

Adjust this list according to the actual structure of your repo (if it differs, replace or add paths).

## Quick deploy

1. Make changes to the site files (for example `index.html`, `css/`, or `assets/`).
2. Commit and push to the `master` branch (or `main`, depending on your repo):

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update site"
git push origin master
```

3. GitHub Pages will automatically publish the content if the repository is configured as a Pages site (a repo named `username.github.io` publishes from the `master`/`main` branch).

If you use a different branch or folder (`gh-pages`, `/docs`), adjust the configuration in Settings → Pages.

## Technologies

- HTML5
- CSS3 (and/or frameworks like Bootstrap / Tailwind if you use them)
- JavaScript

Add the libraries and tools you actually use here (for example: `Jekyll`, `Hugo`, `Eleventy`, `SASS`).

## Quick customization

- Change meta tags (title, description) in `index.html` to improve SEO.
- Replace images in `assets/` with optimized versions (WebP / ~200–400 KB depending on needs).

## How to contribute

If you'd like to help or propose changes:

Alternatively, you can open an issue with suggestions before implementing.

If you want, I can replace the original `README.md` with this version directly (let me know). I can also adapt the text to include more project-specific details (for example, used frameworks or build instructions) if you paste the current README content here.
